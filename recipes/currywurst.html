        <h2 class="recipe-steps">Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Take vegan brat sausages out of the packaging and cut them into bite-sized slices. If serving with fries/potato wedges, prepare them now following package instructions.</li>
            <li>To cook the curry sauce: Heat oil in a (non-stick) skillet pan. Once hot enough add sausage slices and fry until nicely browned (around 3 to 5 minutes). Then add 1 tablespoon of curry powder and stir-fry shortly. When flavors are enhanced, deglazed with vegetable broth. Add tomato sauce, agave, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and the remaining curry and paprika powder. Let everything simmer for at least 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with some more paprika if needed. Add salt, and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Arrange on a plate and sprinkle with more curry powder, if desired add chili flakes. Serve with french fries, potato wedges, or a slice of bread. Enjoy!</li>
